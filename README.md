# THREE-Cube
![ThreeJS Cube Animation](/assets/three-cube.png)
A background design / experiment in ThreeJS. Hosted on my homepage at: [https://gperilli.dev/graphicswork/three-cube/](https://gperilli.dev/graphicswork/pcb-cube/).

## Downloading and Setting Up A Development Workspace

THREE-Cube here runs on HTML, CSS, and JS files - with JS modules which are supported by most modern browsers. 

The project code can be downloaded from this repository with a direct download, or alternatively, using a git clone command: git clone ``git@github.com:gperilli/three-pcb.git``.

## Installing node packages
This project uses npm for javascript packages. To use npm, please install node, and then npm. The packages can be installed by typing the command `npm install` in the project directory. All javascript packages should appear in a newly created `node_modules` directory.

## Building production code
Webpack can be used to produce minified production javascript.`npm start` will run webpack which outputs the minified javascript into the dist directory.

## Using a Local Server
The Go Live feature in Visual Studio Code, or something like WAMP can be used to run and serve the code locally.
